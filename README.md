# ssbu-character-icons
This is a storage repository for 200x200 SSBU character icons.
There are also some .xlsx files which can be used to import the icons into a google sheet.
1. _FetchIcons.xlsx_ imports the icons exactly as they were in the original source.
2. _FetchCustomizedIcons.xlsx_ is a WIP alternative which attempts to somewhat normalize the icons.

**Importing into a Google Sheet**
1. Download your choice of .xlsx file from this repository.
2. In your Google Sheet, select: _File_ -> _Import_ -> _Upload_ -> _Browse_.
3. Navigate to the .xlsx file on your computer and select + upload it.
4. A menu titled _Import file_ should be displayed. For _Import Location_, you probably want to select _Insert new sheet(s)_.
5. Choose _Import Data_.
6. At this point, you may need to _Allow access_ to _receieve data_ (the images) from _external parties_ (this Github repo).
7. Locate the newly inserted sheet. Verify that the insertion worked.
8. On the new sheet with the images, you should do: _Select All_ + _Copy_ + _Paste Values Only_. This will replace the image retrieval formulas with the actual images.

**Other Notes**

Falco's second alt was manually made by me using Pixlr, since it was missing from the original source. I did a poor job, so if someone wants to make a better one it would be appreciated.
